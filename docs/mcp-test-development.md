# Using Model Context Protocol (MCP) for Test Development

To create new tests using the Model Context Protocol (MCP):

1. Start the MCP server:

   ```sh
   cd tests
   npx @playwright/test run-server --port=3000
   ```

2. Create a client script similar to `mcp-client.js` to test your scenario
3. Run the client to verify the steps work:

   ```sh
   node mcp-client.js
   ```

4. Once verified, create a Playwright test file in the `tests/e2e` directory

# Creating New Tests

Follow this workflow to create new end-to-end tests:

1. Define your test scenario (e.g., "Navigate to website X, perform action Y, verify result Z")
2. Run all steps using the Playwright MCP to validate they work
3. Create a TypeScript test file in the `tests/e2e` directory following the `.spec.ts` format
4. Execute and refine the test until it passes reliably

You can also use the prompt template in `tests/prompts/generate_e2e_test.md` with GitHub Copilot in agent mode to help generate tests.
